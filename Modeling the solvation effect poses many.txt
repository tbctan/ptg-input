Modeling the solvation effect poses many challenges and is non-trivial, especially on edge states.
Many papers have examined the water model, starting from a single water molecule and increasing in complexity towards a water layer or double/triple water layer in the explicit model, or shifting towards an implicit model, which does not account for the effect of water ions.
To examine the solvation effect using the explicit water model, a single water molecule is not sufficient, and a water dimer is the minimum model that accounts for hydrogen bonds.
The water layer is the established model on periodic surfaces, but even this is limited in accuracy, and modelign a water layer interacting with the catalyst edge was computationally difficult. To address this, the comprehensive examination of the solvation effect is subject to further investigation in succeeding works, and a line mentioning this has been added to hte main text.
We acknowledge this is not a complete model of the edge-water interactions, but a compromise, as creating a larger cluster or surrounding the catalyst edge with water using first-principles calculations may not be faesible to calculate.
The water molecules, Pt, C, and H atoms of the atrget catalyst, and srorbates are completely relaxed, except for the bottom H Row and bottom two C rows. The optimized structures and input files examining solvation will be included in the supplementary databset mentioned in 1).Modeling the solvation effect poses many challenges and is non-trivial, especially on edge states.
